    Parties are all I have. You can't just do this. ðŸ¤¬

    Sad enough for me, parties can be deleted, but only by admins
    Only group administrators can perform /delete and /clear commands
    You can pull @admins party to ask them to perform this command

    Type `/help delete` or `/help clear` for more information
